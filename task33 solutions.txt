Part -1 On ``sleep_efficiency`` dataset
---------------------------------------



Find out the average sleep duration of top15 male
candidates who's sleep duration are equal to
7.5 or greater than 7.5.

Problem 2: Show avg deep sleep time
for both gender. Round result at 2
decimal places.

Note: sleep time and deep sleep percentage will give you, deep sleep time.

Problem 3:
The question is:

Find out the lowest
10th to 30th light sleep percentage
records where deep sleep percentage 
values are between 25 to 45. Display age,
light sleep percentage and deep sleep 
percentage columns only.

Problem 4: 
Group by on exercise frequency and

average deep sleep time, 
average light sleep time and avg rem sleep time.

sleep time for smoking and non smoking status

Problem 5: Group By on Awekning and
show AVG Caffeine consumption, AVG Deep sleep time
 and AVG Alcohol consumption only for 
people who do exercise atleast 3 days a week.
 Show result in descending order awekenings
